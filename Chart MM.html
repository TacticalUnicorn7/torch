    <h1>What will go down a ramp faster? An M and M or a jelly bean?</h1>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We had a ramp and we rolled jelly beans and M and M’s down it, we used three different ramp heights, high, medium, and low, we didn’t have a protractor so we estimated.<br> We recorded the time when we heard it hit the floor.</p>
    <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>On the high ramp M and M’s were clearly faster. On the medium ramp the data was inconsistent, some M and M’s were faster and some jelly beans were faster than M and M’s,<br> they were pretty even but for the medium ramp jelly beans seemed to be faster. On the small ramp the jelly beans were faster again,<br> the only problem is we had to drop the M and M’s from a tiny height, otherwise they would not go down the ramp. In the end there doesn't seem to be a faster one, the data was too inconsistent and it could have been due to human error with the stopwatch.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Our conclusion is that M and M's are faster than Jelly beans in all three categories, although it was only by 0.06 seconds on medium and by 0.02 seconds on high.<br> On low M and M’s were clearly faster, and for the overall average, M and M’s were only faster by 0.05 seconds.
